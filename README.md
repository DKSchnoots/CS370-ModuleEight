# CS370-ModuleEight

1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this course, I was given a baseline of the TreasureHuntGame. In the Javis_Jamie_ProjectTwo.ipynb Notebook, there is a section titled #To-Do. In this section I wrote code that would create an intelligent agent that would go for the “treasure”. I was able to apply a Deep Q-learning algorithm that would help the agent become quicker based on the epsilon value.
2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
	Computer scientists analyze, develop and design the software and hardware for the applications and machines we use. It’s easier to think of them as the computer problem solves. It matters because we live in a world with loads of different technologies and an ever-expanding market for needs in this development. The need for computer scientists will be there as long as there’s computers/technology that demands a problem to have solved.
- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
	As a computer scientist, I like to look at what the problem needing to be fixed is. Once I know what the problem is and the goal that solving the problem will fix I can begin to execute the steps necessary. I think it’s important to know the challenges being faced and then find a solution, whether its something I have to execute or something that already exists.
- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
	My responsibility when bringing an application to a user or company is to ensure their safety. This can entail their data security and even the algorithms that may be used and how it will interact with their data. I wouldn’t want to extort the con summers by stealing their information or potentially harming them mentally, financially or emotionally. I also want to make sure that the end product is usable and has little to no issues so the user doesn’t get overwhelmed and can use the product carefree
